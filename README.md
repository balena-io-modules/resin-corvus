# resin-corvus
A wrapper around Sentry and Mixpanel that works in the browser, Node and Electron.

## Setup
Install via npm:
```bash
npm install resin-corvus
```

## Autotracking
Do note with Mixpanel: autotracking is enabled by default. This sends evends
such as any mouseclicks regardless. [This can be disabled in the Mixpanel service
itself.](https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-do-i-know-what-data-autotrack-is-collecting-and-what-if-im-not-comfortable-with-the-data-being-collected-can-i-turn-off-collection-of-specific-data)
